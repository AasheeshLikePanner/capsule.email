## Why I Built This

I really love open source.  
That's why I decided to make Capsule.email open for everyone to use, host, and contribute to.

Right now, I don’t have the funds to buy a domain or cover AI credits – so instead of limiting access, I’m sharing everything.  
You can self-host it and use it however you like.

If you find it useful, consider contributing or spreading the word.
